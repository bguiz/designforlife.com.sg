        <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>
<h3>Michael Graetz B.Arch, M.Arch, ASIA</h3>
<span class="left-m">Architect and Zoological Exhibit Designer</span><br />
<hr><br />

<p><span><img src="images/Michael-Graetz06s.jpg" alt="Michael Graetz with clouded leopard" width="200px" align="left" hspace="10px" vspace="5px" /></span>
Now an independent consultant, Michael Graetz spent nearly 20
years with Singapore Zoo as an architect and exhibit designer.
Starting as the zoo's resident architect, he became a
Director in 2000, heading the Zoo?s Creative Design Team (CDT).</p>

<p>More than 100 million dollars has gone into developments by
Singapore Zoological Gardens (including the Night Safari) and
Mike oversaw around three quarters of that investment. As the
pace of development increased through the 1990s, additional
designers were engaged and Mike became the head of the
Creative Design Team.</p>

<p>Mike launched Design For Life in 2004</p>

<p>His work in Singapore Zoo has made Mike a highly experienced zoo designer, combining design skills with special insight
into the zoological and operational needs of successful zoos.</p>

<p>Singapore is famous for having the world's first zoological park dedicated to nocturnal
wildlife, which is open only at night - the Night Safari. Mike was a key member of the team
that developed the Night Safari concept. Among other major projects Mike handled are
Fragile Forest, the award-winning Hamadryas Baboon ? The Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia,
and Elephants of Asia. These developments contributed to the string of tourism awards
received by the Zoo and Night Safari throughout this period.</p>

<p>Singapore Zoo was conceived in the early 1970s as the 'Open Zoo' to reflect a conscious
break with the traditional zoo built around cages and indoor displays. By the late 1990s,
this idea was so well accepted among world zoos that it no longer set Singapore apart. The
major projects embarked upon then were part of a process aimed at modernising the Zoo,
reinventing it as a unique tourist attraction and maintaining its place at the 'cutting edge'
of zoo design.</p>

<p>Key to this was the master re-development plan produced in the late 1990s with the tag
line, ?Journeys to Wild Places?. Mike and his team subsequently organised a series of
creative design workshops to kick start the projects outlined in the Master Plan. This
method of planning and design by workshop proved a fast and effective methodology that
spurs creativity and innovation. As Director of the CDT, Mike led a team of up to four
designers with two support staff and coordinated a diverse array of local and foreign
consultants brought in for specific projects or gathered for events such as the workshops to
ensure the high level of innovation was maintained.</p>

<p>Over the years of Mike?s tenure, Singapore Zoo became sought after for its design expertise
and consultancy became an increasing activity. This is due not least to the participation of
Mike as designer, coordinator and team leader. He has worked on projects throughout Asia ?
in Indonesia, China, India, Cambodia, Seychelles and U.A.E.</p>

<p>Mike obtained a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of South Australia in 1982. In
1995 he was awarded a Master of Architecture degree by dissertation from the National
University of Singapore on zoo exhibit design and its role in the social objectives of
zoological gardens.</p>

<p>On joining Singapore Zoo in 1984, he held the post of Architect and became first Head of
the CDT and in 2000 a Director of Wildlife Reserves Singapore, the company formed when
the Zoo merged with Jurong Bird Park. He has participated in ongoing staff training
programmes of WRS; introducing keepers to the principles of exhibit design, and organised
design workshops for SEAZA, the South East Asia Zoo Association.</p>
